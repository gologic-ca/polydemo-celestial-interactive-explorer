### **Project Description:**  
Develop a **Retro Basketball Scoreboard App** that immerses users in the classic vibe of old-school basketball scoreboards while providing robust functionality for real-time game tracking. The app will allow users to manage scores, fouls, timers, and player information, including substitutions, personal fouls, and individual performance metrics. A registration system for teams and players will enhance pre-game preparation.  

The app will be highly interactive, featuring a nostalgic retro design with analog-inspired elements and engaging animations. All data will be managed locally in the browser without external database dependencies.
